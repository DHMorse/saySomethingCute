# Say Something Cute  

A Vencord plugin that changes the Discord message input placeholder from "Message #channel" to "Send something cute... ✨"  

## Features  

- Changes the message input placeholder text to "Send something cute... ✨"  
- Applies cute styling with italic font and pink color  
- Automatically reapplies after sending messages  
- Restores original placeholders when disabled  

## Theme Compatibility  

This plugin works especially well with [my edit of the Leancord theme](https://github.com/DHMorse/Leancord/tree/myChanges). The cute placeholder text seamlessly matches the refined aesthetic, enhancing the overall look and feel.  

Leancord was originally created by [SublimeSlime](https://github.com/SublimeSlime/Leancord), and my modifications build upon its sleek and minimal design.  

## Version  

Current version: 1.0.1
